<h1>8 Running a Report</h1>
<p>
This section describes how to view, save, and print the output of a
report.
</p>

<p>
For information about running DataVision from the command line, see <a
href="rundv.html"><span class="sec">Starting DataVision</span></a>.
</p>

<!-- ================================================================ -->
<a name="onscreen">
<h2>8.1 Displaying a Report On-screen</h2>
<p>
To view a report, select <span class="guimenuitem">Run Report</span> from the
<span class="guimenu">Report</span> menu. A new Report View window opens, displaying
the first page of the report. As more data is loaded, more pages become
available. From this window, you can print a report or export the results
to a file.
</p>

<p>
If you cancel a report, either by closing the Report View window or
clicking the <span class="guibutton">Cancel</span> button in the status dialog, the
report run will be canceled and the Report View window will be closed.
</p>

<p>
The toolbar contains buttons for printing, exporting, and navigating
between report pages.
</p>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
<a name="saving">
<h2>8.2 Saving a Report's Output</h2>
<p>
From the Report View window, you may print the report or save its output
in any of the formats allowed by the layout engines. See <a
href="le.html"><span class="sec">Layout Engines</span></a> for a list of available layout
engines and their file formats.
</p>

<p>
Alternately, you can run DataVision from the command line, specifying a
layout engine and an optional output file name. See <a
href="rundv.html#runcmd"><span class="sec">Running DataVision from the Command
Line</span></a> for a command synopsis.
</p>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
<a name="printing">
<h2>8.3 Printing a Report's Output</h2>
<p>
Reports can be printed from within the Report View window or by printing
an output file generated by one of the layout engines.
</p>

<p>
To print a report from within DataVision, run the report. The
<span class="guimenuitem">Print</span> menu item and printer button will become
enabled as soon as the last report page is read. Click either one to print
the report.
</p>

<p>
While the report is printing, a status dialog displays the page number
being printed. Click <span class="guibutton">Cancel</span> to cancel printing.
</p>

<!-- ................................................................ -->
<h3>8.3.1 Printing from DataVision</h3>
<p>
From the Report View window, use <span class="guimenuitem">Print</span> from
the <span class="guimenu">File</span> menu to send the report to a printer.
Alternately, you can click the print button on the toolbar.
</p>

<!-- Two options: from Swing layout engine and from command line. -->

<!-- ................................................................ -->
<h3>8.3.2 Printing a Report Output File</h3>
<p>
Printing or viewing an exported output file from the command line is
system dependent. For example, you can use DataVision to generate an HTML
file or a comma-delimited <span class="file">.csv</span> text file. Opening that file
depends upon your system: you can use your favorite Web browser to open and
print the HTML file or a spreadsheet program to open and print the
comma-delimited file.
</p>

<p>
The LaTeX layout engine produces a LaTeX2e <span class="file">.tex</span> file. This
file is in turn used to produce a device independent <span class="file">.dvi</span>
file, most likely by running the command <span class="command">latex</span>. There
are many tools available to translate either the <span class="file">.tex</span> or the
<span class="file">.dvi</span> file into almost any format you may wish: text, HTML,
PostScript, PDF, and more.
</p>

<!-- ................................................................ -->
<h3>8.3.3 Quitting under Mac OS X</h3>
<p>
<span class="note">Note</span>: Under Mac OS X, be sure to quit DataVision by
selecting <span class="guimenuitem">Quit</span> from the <span class="guimenu">File</span>
menu (or its keyboard shortcut) that appears in the Design Window.
</p>

<p>
Do <em>not</em> use <span class="guimenuitem">Quit</span> found in the
<span class="guimenu">jimm.datavision.DataVision</span> application menu at the top
of the screen. Quitting that way does not let DataVision ask you about
saving your report. You will <em>loose all changes</em> that have not been
saved.
</p>

<p>
DataVision is written to be as cross-platform as possible. That means it
does not take advantage of the &quot;hooks&quot; that Apple provides for
interacting with Mac OS X.
