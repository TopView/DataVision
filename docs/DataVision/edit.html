<h1>7 Editing a Report</h1>
<p>
This section briefly describes the most common actions performed when
editing a report. For a complete description of the DataVision GUI, see <a
href="gui.html"><span class="sec">The DataVision User Interface</span></a>.
</p>

<p>
Fields have popup menus. Sections have popup menus. The section labels
on the left side have popup menus.
</p>

<!-- ================================================================ -->
<a name="addingfields">
<h2>7.1 Adding Fields</h2>
<p>
To add a database field, formula, parameter, aggregate, or special field
to a report, select the corresponding menu item from the
<span class="guimenu">Insert</span> menu. The Field Picker window will open, allowing
you to select and drag a field from that window onto the report.
</p>

<p>
The Field Picker window also lets you create new formulas and parameter
fields. Use the <span class="guimenu">New Formula...</span> or <span class="guimenu">New
Parameter...</span> menu items from the <span class="guimenu">Field</span>
menu.
</p>

<p>
To add a static text label, select <span class="guimenuitem">Text</span> from
the <span class="guimenu">Insert</span> menu. The cursor will turn into a text
cursor. When you click the mouse in any section, a new editable text label
will appear.
</p>

<p>
See <a href="#addaggr"><span class="sec">Aggregates</span></a> for adding aggregate fields.
</p>

<p>
To add an image, select <span class="guimenuitem">Image...</span> from the
<span class="guimenu">Insert</span> menu. A dialog box will open, letting you type in
the URL or file path for the image. (If you type in a relative file path
like &quot;example/postgres.xml&quot; or URL like &quot;file:example/postgres.xml&quot;, it
must be relative to the DataVision directory, not to the report XML file.)
When you enter the URL, the image is inserted into the report in the top
left corner of the Report Header. From there, you may move the image
anywhere else in the report. See <a
href="anatomy.html#imagefield"><span class="sec">image fields</span></a> for more
information.
</p>

<p>
Only image formats understood by the Java Swing interface (GIF, JPEG) may
be created using the DataVision GUI. That's because I haven't yet written
the code that will visually represent images that Swing can't understand.
</p>

<p>
To change how a field is displayed, select <span class="guimenuitem">Format
Field...</span> from the <span class="guimenu">Format</span> menu or from a
field's popup menu. See <a href="gui.html#formatdialog"><span class="sec">The Format
Dialog</span></a> for details.
</p>

<!-- ================================================================ -->
<a name="selectingfields">
<h2>7.2 Selecting Fields</h2>
<p>
To select a field, single-click it. To select more than one field, hold
down the shift key while selecting the fields.
</p>

<p>
<span class="note">Not yet implemented:</span> You may also select fields by clicking
and dragging a selection box with the mouse.
</p>

<!-- ================================================================ -->
<a name="removingfields">
<h2>7.3 Removing Fields</h2>
<p>
To remove a single field, select it and hit the delete or backspace key.
You may also right-click on the field and select
<span class="guimenuitem">Delete</span> from the popup menu.
</p>

<p>
To remove a formula or parameter from the report, open the Field Picker
window, select the formula or parameter, and select
<span class="guimenuitem">Cut</span> from the <span class="guimenu">Edit</span> menu. You
can only remove formulas and parameters that are not used somewhere in the
report. If the <span class="guimenuitem">Cut</span> menu item is not enabled when
you select a formula or parameter, that means it is being used somewhere in
the report.
</p>

<!-- ================================================================ -->
<a name="movingfields">
<h2>7.4 Moving and Re-sizing Fields</h2>
<p>
Click and drag a field to move it. Drag the edges to re-size it. Moving
and dragging operate on the current selection, so if multiple fields are
selected they will all be moved or re-sized.
</p>

<!-- ================================================================ -->

<a name="addaggr">
<h2>7.5 Aggregates</h2>
<p>
To create a new aggregate field, either right-click on a field and select
<span class="guimenuitem">Aggregate...</span> from the popup menu or select a field
by single-clicking it and then select <span class="guimenuitem">Aggregate
Field...</span> from the <span class="guimenu">Insert</span> menu. A dialog box
appears that lets you select where you would like aggregates to appear for
this field, and what type of aggregate to use where.
</p>

<p>
The field you want to aggregate must be in the details section. (It can be
hidden, if you don't want to display its value.) It must be a numeric
column, a formula, a user column, or a numeric parameter.
</p>

<!-- ================================================================ -->
<a name="parameters">
<h2>7.6 Parameters</h2>
<p>
Double-clicking a parameter field, either in the Report Design window or
the Field Picker window, opens the dialog box appropriate for the parameter
type (string, number, or date). Alternately, you can right-click on the
parameter field in the Report Design window and select
<span class="guimenuitem">Edit...</span> from the popup menu or you can select
<span class="guimenuitem">Edit Parameter...</span> from the
<span class="guimenu">Field</span> menu in the Field Picker window.
</p>

<p>
<span class="note">To be written.</span>
</p>

<!-- ================================================================ -->
<a name="formulas">
<h2>7.7 Formulas</h2>
<p>
Formulas are <a href="anatomy.html#bsf"><span class="sec">Bean Scripting
Framework</span></a> (BSF) scripts that can contain database fields,
parameters, and more.
</p>

<p>
Double-clicking a formula field, either in the Report Design window or
the Field Picker window, opens the formula editor dialog box. Alternately,
you can right-click on the formula in the Report Design window and select
<span class="guimenuitem">Edit...</span> from the popup menu or you can select
<span class="guimenuitem">Edit Formula...</span> from the
<span class="guimenu">Field</span> menu in the Field Picker window.
</p>

<p>
The main text pane in the dialog box that is opened lets you edit the
text of the formula. For more information about this dialog see <a
href="gui.html#formulaeddialog"><span class="sec">The Formula Editor
Dialog</span></a>.
</p>

<p>
For more information about BSF, see <a href="anatomy.html#bsf"><span class="sec">Bean
Scripting Framework</span></a>.
</p>


<!-- ================================================================ -->
<a name="groups">
<h2>7.8 Groups</h2>
<p>
The sort order of a group determines the order in which a group's values
are selected. For example, if the &quot;office.name&quot; group of a report has
three possible values (New York, New Jersey, and Chicago) then the sort
order determines which office's detail records are displayed first. When
sorted ascending, Chicago's records will be first, then New Jersey and
finally New York. When sorted descending, New York will be first. This is
not the same as the sort order of the detail records within a group. (See
<a href="#sorting"><span class="sec">Sorting Records</span></a> for information about
sorting detail records.)
</p>

<p>
To edit the sort order of a group's values or the nesting order of groups
within a report, open the <span class="guimenuitem">Group By...</span> dialog
from the <span class="guimenu">Report</span> menu. See <a
href="gui.html#groupbydialog"><span class="sec">The &quot;Group By&quot; Dialog</span></a> for
more information about this dialog.
</p>


<!-- ================================================================ -->
<a name="subreports">
<h2>7.9 Subreports</h2>
<p>
A subreport is a report within a report. The subreport's query runs each
time the subreport's field needs to be output.
</p>

<a name="addsubreport">
<h3>7.9.1 Adding a Subreport</h3>
<ol>

<li>Select &quot;Sub-Report&quot; from the &quot;Insert&quot; menu.</li>

<li>The table joiner dialog appears. Select the columns that join together
the two reports. The first column will be filled with the current value in
the master report. The second will be a SELECT column for the sub-report.

<p>
For example, selecting &quot;office.name <= office.name&quot; will fill the first
office.name with the current value of the office name from the master
report. Let's say the master report's office name value is currently
'Chicago'. The sub-report's query will then contain a WHERE clause that
ends with &quot;... AND 'Chicago' <= office.name&quot;.</li>

<li>When you click &quot;OK&quot;, a file chooser dialog appears. Select the
sub-report for importing.</li>

<li>The sub-report is read in. Only the detail section area is read; all the
headers and footers are ignored.</li>

<li>A new field is inserted into the master report's detail section. It is
a single field, no matter how many fields are in the sub-report's detail
section. You can of course move the field anywhere else in the
report.</li>

</ol>


<a name="runsubreport">
<h3>7.9.2 When the Report Runs</h3>
<p>
When you run the master report, the contents of the sub-report field are
populated with multiple lines of text, one for each row returned by the
sub-report. Each line of the text is a simple concatenation of the fields
in the sub-report's detail section, separated by spaces.
</p>

<p>
For example, if the sub-report's detail section had three fields
&quot;name.first&quot;, &quot;name.middle&quot;, and &quot;name.last&quot;, each line of the output
would be &quot;First Middle Last&quot;.
</p>


<a name="subreportproblems">
<h3>7.9.3 Problems</h3>
<p>
The sub-report field does not expand vertically (no DataVision field yet
knows how to expand itself).
</p>

<p>
The way of generating the contents of the sub-report field is pretty
stupid. This should improve in future releases.
</p>


<!-- ================================================================ -->
<a name="sorting">
<h2>7.10 Sorting Records</h2>
<p>
Detail records may be sorted using any combination of user columns and
database columns. The order in which columns are sorted is significant. In
the example database, job records have an id and a date. Sorting the
records by date and then id will return the records in a different order
than sorting them by id and then date.
</p>

<p>
A column may be sorted in ascending or descending order. Ascending order
means lower values are first.
</p>

<p>
To edit the list of sorted columns and their order, open the
<span class="guimenuitem">Sort By...</span> dialog from the
<span class="guimenu">Report</span> menu. See <a
href="gui.html#sortbydialog"><span class="sec">The &quot;Sort By&quot; Dialog</span></a> for more
information about this dialog.
</p>

<p>
The user columns and database columns used by groups do not appear in the
&quot;Sort By&quot; dialog. To change the sort order of groups, use <a
href="gui.html#groupbydialog"><span class="sec">The &quot;Group By&quot; Dialog</span></a>. See
<a href="edit.html#groups"><span class="sec">Groups</span></a> for more information about
editing groups.
</p>

<!-- ================================================================ -->
<a name="selecting">
<h2>7.11 Selecting Records</h2>
<p>
By default, running a report retrieves and displays all of the records
from all of the tables in your report. It is often desirable to limit the
records that are retrieved.
</p>

<p>
When reading records from a database, you use a SQL WHERE clause to specify
which records you want to retrieve. (The WHERE clause is also used to
specify how tables in your SQL query are joined, but we are not concerned
about that right now. For information about joining tables, see <a
href="#joining"><span class="sec">Joining Tables</span></a>.) The SQL specification is
beyond the scope of this document. See your database's documentation.
</p>

<p>
When reading records from a comma- or tab-separated file, you select records
use a <a href="anatomy.html#bsf"><span class="sec">BSF</span></a> script. The script must
return a boolean (true/false) value. If the returned value is true, the record
will be included in the report.
</p>

<p>
To edit the text of the WHERE clause or BSF script, use the <a
href="gui.html#selrecsdialog"><span class="sec">Select Records</span></a> dialog.
</p>

<p>
The text you enter may contain columns, formulas, and parameters. You can
type their names (using the proper format) or simply drag them in from the
<a href="gui.html#fieldpicker"><span class="sec">Field Picker</span></a> window. Formulas
look like &quot;{@My Formula}&quot; and parameters look like &quot;{?My Parameter}&quot;.
</p>


<a name="dbcolnames">
<h3>7.11.1 Database Column Names</h3>
<p>
You can enter database column names with or without the curly braces. (When
you drag them from the Field Picker window, the curly braces are used.) The
curly braces make a difference when the database column's name is not all
lower case (or all upper case, depending upon your database). Column names
without curly braces will not be quoted. That means the JDBC driver may
automatically convert the name to all lower case or all upper case. This
causes problems when your database was created using mixed-case names, for
example. See <a href="#namecase"><span class="sec">Database Name Case
Sensitivity</span></a> for details.
</p>

<p>
To summarize: when you need to enter a mixed-case name because the
table or column name is mixed-case, use quotes around the name.
</p>

<p>
The quotes go around the parts of the name that need them, not the whole
name. For example, if the table name is &quot;table&quot; and the column name is
&quot;MyCol&quot;, the quotes don't go around the entire name &quot;table.MyCol&quot;.
Instead, you would need to type
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
table.&quot;MyCol&quot;
</pre>




<a name="selparameters">
<h3>7.11.2 Parameters</h3>
<p>
When using a parameter that is a string, do <em>not</em> enclose the
parameter in quotes. If you do, you will see an error message like
&quot;Parameter index out of range&quot; when you run your report.
</p>

<p>
If you want to combine a &quot;like&quot; string comparison that uses wildcards
with a parameter value you need to concatenate the parameter with the
wildcard characters. Here's an example. Let's say you want to run a report
that only displays records where the &quot;name&quot; column starts with a
user-selected prefix string. You would create a parameter called "Start of
Name" that will be used to ask the user to enter the start of the name.
Next you use the Select Records dialog to set the SQL WHERE clause to
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
upper(table.name) like upper({?Start of Name} || '%')
</pre>

<p>
The characters &quot;||&quot; are the string concatenation operator, at least for
Oracle and PostgreSQL. The string '%' is the wildcard character that we
are appending to the end of the user's string. To search for the user's
string anywhere in the name column, add wildcards to the beginning and the
end, like this:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
upper(table.name) like upper('%' || {?Start of Name} || '%')
</pre>


<!-- ================================================================ -->
<a name="joining">
<h2>7.12 Joining Tables</h2>
<p>
When two or more tables appear in your report, you probably want to join
them together by one or more common columns. To do so, use the <a
href="gui.html#vislinkerdialog"><span class="sec">Visual Table Linker</span></a> dialog.
</p>

<!-- ================================================================ -->
<a name="startup">
<h2>7.13 Startup Script</h2>
<p>
The startup script runs at the beginning of the report, before any data is
read. The script is <a href="anatomy.html#bsf"><span class="sec">Bean Scripting
Framework</span></a> (BSF) code, not SQL. Edit the startup script by selecting
<span class="guimenuitem">Startup Script</span> from the <span class="guimenu">Report</span>
menu. Any variables you set in this script are available to all of the rest of
your formulas. <span class="note">Note: all the formulas in the same language; I'm not sure
about other languages.</span>
</p>

<!-- ================================================================ -->
<a name="pagebreaks">
<h2>7.14 Page Breaks</h2>
<p>
Each section can force a page break before it outputs data. To turn a
section's page break on or off, open its popup menu and select
<span class="guimenuitem">New Page Before</span>. The menu item will be checked
when this feature is on and unchecked when it is off.
</p>

<!-- ================================================================ -->
<a name="namecase">
<h2>7.15 Database Name Case Sensitivity</h2>
<p>
Some databases support case-sensitive names. In those database, the column
named &quot;mycol&quot; is different from the column named &quot;MyCol&quot;.
Unfortunately, the programs that access databases such as JDBC drivers and
command-line tools like PostgreSQL's psql often confuse the issue by
changing all names to lower case or upper case internally before sending
the query to the database. When you type &quot;select MyCol from MyTable&quot; it
sends &quot;select mycol from my table&quot; to the database.
</p>

<p>
If your database was created using names with only lower case (or upper
case) letters, you may not see any problem. Your queries always work
because no matter what case you use, the names are converted to all lower
case (or upper case) and everything is fine.
</p>

<p>
In order to access a column named &quot;MyCol&quot; using a tool that converts the
names, you have to quote the mixed-case names. For example, the query
&quot;select MyCol from MyTable&quot; must be entered as
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
select "MyCol" from "MyTable"
</pre>

<p>
The quotes go around the parts of the name that need them, not the whole
name. For example, the quotes don't go around the entire name
&quot;MyTable.MyCol&quot;. Instead, you would need to type
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
select &quot;MyTable&quot;.&quot;MyCol&quot;
</pre>

<p>
As of version 0.6.0 of DataVision, database table and column names are
case-sensitive. All table and column names are quoted if their case does
not match the case the JDBC driver uses when executing SQL queries
</p>

<p>
DataVision's internal searches for columns (for example, when loading a
report XML file) now perform case-sensitive searches. <span class="note">This may break
reports designed manually, especially if you used all upper-case for your
table and column names.</span>
</p>

<p>
Using previous versions of DataVision along with many (most) JDBC drivers,
it was impossible to query a case-sensitive database. Since DataVision did
not quote table or column names (unless the name contained a space), the
JDBC driver would convert all of the names.
</p>

<p>
Use the <b>-q</b> command line flag to disable this new behavior. Table and
column names will not be quoted when sent to the database (unless the name
contains a space) and internal searches for columns will be
case-insensitive.
</p>

<p>
Not that if you only used the DataVision GUI to create your report, you
probably won't see any difference. The table and column names were
retrieved from the database and saved to the report XML file using the
correct case.
</p>

<p>
Any column name within curly braces is automatically quoted by DataVision
(unless you use <b>-q</b>), so you don't need to add the quotes. Also, if
you drag a column from the Field Picker window to another window like the
&quot;Select Records...&quot; window, the column's name is surrounded by curly
braces and you don't have to add any quotes.
