<h3>9.1.1 The Report Design Window</h3>
<p>
The Report Design window is the main window used to edit, save, and run a
report. To the left are section areas which contain one or more labelled
sections, to the right are the sections containing report fields. The labels,
sections, and fields all have popup menus that appear when you right-click
them.
</p>

<p>
Drag the bars to re-size report sections.
</p>

<p>
To select a field, single-click it. To select more than one field, hold
down the shift key while selecting the fields. <span class="note">Not yet
implemented:</span> You may also select fields by clicking and dragging a
selection box with the mouse.
</p>

<p>
Click and drag a field to move it. Drag the edges to re-size it. Moving
and dragging operate on the current selection. If multiple fields are
selected they will all be moved or re-sized.
</p>

<p>
Field commands (format, re-size) operate on the set of currently
selected fields.
</p>

<p>
To insert a new section into a section area, right-click on a section label or
section and select &quot;Insert Section&quot;.

<h3>9.1.2 The Field Picker Window</h3>
<p>
When you select one of the field types from the
<span class="guimenu">Insert</span> menu on the design window, this window opens. It
contains a tree list containing all database field types except text
labels. Click and drag a field to add it to the report.
</p>

<p>
The first item in the window is &quot;Database Fields&quot; and the last item is
&quot;All Database Fields&quot;. In a newly created report, the first &quot;Database
Fields&quot; item will be empty, because it displays database columns that are
already in the report.
</p>

<p>
Drag database columns, formulas, parameters, user columns, or special
fields from the Field Picker window into the report. As an added bonus,
when you drag a database column into a &quot;Detail&quot; section, the name of the
column will automagically appear in the &quot;Page Header&quot; section.
</p>

<p>
This window also lets you create and edit formulas and parameters.
Select the appropriate menu item from the <span class="guimenu">Field</span>
menu.

<h3>9.1.3 The Report View</h3>
<p>
When you run a report by selecting <span class="guimenuitem">Run
Report...</span> from the <span class="guimenu">Report</span> menu, a report
view window opens and displays the report output.
</p>

<p>
From this window you may print the report or export it using one of the
other layout engines.
</p>

<p>
See <a href="runreport.html"><span class="sec">Running a Report</span></a> for more
information on the Report View window.
</p>

<!-- :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: -->
<a name="dialogs">
<h2>9.2 Dialogs</h2>
<!-- ................................................................ -->
<a name="aggrdialog">
<h3>9.2.1 The Aggregate Dialog</h3>
<p>
Open by selecting <span class="guimenuitem">Aggregates...</span> from a numeric
field's popup menu or by selecting <span class="guimenuitem">Running Total
Field...</span> from the <span class="guimenu">Insert</span> menu.
</p>

<p>
This dialog will open. Each group and the report footer are displayed, along
with a check box and a popup menu for selecting the aggregate type.
</p>

<!-- ................................................................ -->
<a name="formatdialog">
<h3>9.2.2 The Format Dialog</h3>
<p>
The Format Dialog has two tabs labeled &quot;Format&quot; and &quot;Border&quot;. The
contents of the &quot;Format&quot; tab edit the look of a field (its size, font,
alignment, etc.) The contents of the &quot;Border&quot; tab edit the borders that
surround a field. <span class="note">These borders are not yet displayed by the GUI,
though they are output by layout engines such as the LaTeX engine that
understand them.</span>
</p>

<p>
The title of the Format Dialog displays the name of the field whose format
you are editing. If more than one field is selected, a plus sign (&quot;+&quot;)
appears after the field name and that field is the prototype. Its format
will be used to populate the Format Dialog. If you are editing the
report-wide default format, that will be indicated in the title.
</p>

<p>
The &quot;Format&quot; tab lets you edit a fields font family name, text size,
color, text attributes such as bold, italic, underline, and wrap, text
alignment, and the printing format of numbers and dates.
</p>

<p>
<span class="note">Though field colors respect their alpha component, there is no way
in this dialog to edit that value. You can manually edit the alpha value by
editing the report XML file and changing the final value of the color
string. See <a href="xml.html#fieldformats"><span class="sec">Field Formats</span></a>
for the format of the color string.</span>
</p>

<p>
The &quot;Format&quot; string needs a bit of explaining. It is used by a Java
formatting object that is appropriate for the type of field. For numeric
fields, this string is used as input to a DecimalFormat object. For date
fields, it is used as input to a SimpleDateFormat object.
</p>

<p>
For numeric fields, you create a &quot;picture&quot; of how you want the number to
appear. Use either `#' or `0' characters to represent numbers; `#' will
print blanks if no digit is needed, `0' will print a zero. Add commas or
decimal points where appropriate. The number of `#' characters you use is
not important. To print negative numbers by using a leading minus sign (or
whatever is appropriate for your locale), you need do nothing. To print
negative numbers by using parenthesis, you need to add the string &quot;;(#)&quot;
to the end of your format string.
</p>

<p>
For a complete and detailed discussion of the numeric format strings,
see the <a
href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/java/text/DecimalFormat.html"><span class="class">java.text.DecimalFormat</span>
documentation</a>.
</p>

<p>
Here are a few example numeric format strings, using the separator
characters used in the USA. We will apply each to the number
1,234.0078.
</p>

<dl>

    <dt>#,####</dt><dd> Print with commas but with no decimal places:
    &quot;1,234&quot;</dd>

    <dt>####</dt><dd> Print with no commas and no decimal places:
    &quot;1234&quot;.</dd>

    <dt>####.#</dt><dd> Print with no commas and one decimal place:
    &quot;1234&quot;. No decimal places are printed here because we asked
    for one decimal place only if it is non-zero.</dd>

    <dt>#,###.00</dt><dd> Print with commas and exactly two decimal places:
    &quot;1,234.01&quot;.</dd>

    <dt>$#,###.00</dt><dd> Print as money: &quot;$1,234.01&quot;.</dd>

    <dt>$#,###.00;(#)</dt><dd> Print as money, but use parenthesis if the
    amount is negative: &quot;$1,234.01&quot;.</dd>

</dl>

<p>
For date fields, you create a format string that is understandable by
the <span class="class">SimpleDateFormat</span> class. Briefly, use `y' for year, `M'
for month, `d' for day, `E' for day of the week, and `h', `m', and `s' for
hours, minutes, and seconds. Use 'yyyy' for four-character years and 'yy'
for two-character years. For a complete and detailed discussion of the date
format strings, see the <a
href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html"><span class="class">java.text.SimpleDateFormat</span>
documentation</a>.
</p>

<p>
Here are a few example date format strings, using the date/time August
27, 2002, 12:36 PM.
</p>

<dl>
    <dt>yyyy.MM.dd</dt><dd> 2002.08.27</dd>

    <dt>EEE, MMM d, &quot;yy</dt><dd> Tue, August 27, '02</dd>

    <dt>h:mm a</dt><dd> 12:36 PM</dd>

    <dt>hh 'o&quot;clock' a, zzzz</dt><dd> 12 o'clock PM, Eastern Standard
    Time</dd>

    <dt>yyyyy.MMMMM.dd GGG hh:mm aaa</dt><dd> 2002.August.27 AD 12:36
    PM</dd>
 
</dl>

<p>
The &quot;Border&quot; tab lets you edit the border surrounding a field. You can
specify top, bottom, left, and right borders. Each is defined by a count
(zero, one, two, or three lines), a style (line, dashed, or dotted), and a
thickness in points. Remember: not all layout engines support borders.
<span class="note">Only the line style works.</span>

fields. To the left and right are combo boxes (drop down menus) that let
you select database fields. In the middle is a combo box that defines the
relationship between the two fields (for example, &quot;equals&quot; or &quot;greater
than&quot;).

<h3>9.2.13 The Formula Languages Dialog</h3>
<p>
This dialog lets you select the report's default formula scripting language
and add new languages. See <a

information about adding a language.
</p>

<p>
The &quot;Default Language&quot; is the scripting language that newly created

language does not affect existing formulas.
</p>

<p>
When you add new languages in this dialog, they become available in the
default language drop-down menu and in the <a

href="#startupdialog"><span class="sec">Startup Script</span></a> dialogs.
</p>

<p>
Selecting a language from the default language drop-down menu fills the name
and class fields.
</p>

<p>
Clicking <span class="guibutton">Add/Modify Language</span> adds a new language/class
pair to the list of languages or modifies the class of an existing language.
</p>

<p>
Clicking <span class="guibutton">Test Language</span> checks to see if the class that
you've entered can be loaded by DataVision. If it can't be loaded, that means
the language is not on the class path. You are not prevented from adding a
language that can't be found. This lets you design a report and add the
language's jar file to the class path later. If you try to run the report and
use a language that can't be found, you will see an error message. As
described in <span class="sec">Bean Scripting Framework</span>, you have to add the
language's jar to DataVision's class path before you can use the language.

<h2>9.3 Language Settings</h2>
<p>
If DataVision has been translated into your language, that language
should be used automatically. The Java runtime sets the default language
and region when you start DataVision. If you don't see the proper
translation, use the command line arguments to set the language and region.
See <a href="rundv.html#runcmd"><span class="sec">Running DataVision from the Command
Line</span></a> for a command synopsis.

<p>
Tony Tomov, who translated DataVision into Bulgarian, warns that
Cyrillic characters don't display properly with Java 1.2. Once he upgraded
to Java 1.3, they displayed fine.
